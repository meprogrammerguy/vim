plans to do
1) ssh between windows and linux
remove passphrase
sudo ssh-keygen -p 
pscp /home/jsmith/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub jsmith@jsmith-win:/path/destination_file_name.
===
ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/ubuntu-ed25519 -t ed25519
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/ubuntu-ed25519.pub jsmith@jsmith-win:1222
===
sudo snap connect remmina:avahi-observe :avahi-observe # servers discovery
sudo snap connect remmina:cups-control :cups-control # printing
sudo snap connect remmina:mount-observe :mount-observe # mount management
sudo snap connect remmina:password-manager-service :password-manager-service # password manager
sudo snap connect remmina:audio-playback :audio-playback # audio sharing
sudo snap connect remmina:audio-record :audio-record # microphone

ssh -4 -p 1222 -i /home/jsmith/snap/remmina/common/.ssh/id_rsa jsmith@jsmith-win  
(latest: Keys work to windows box)
added pdf file to explain moving keys from linux to windows 
(remmina data file was set wrong, couldn't find profiles on restart, set to snap folder/remmina)
made backups of these files
===
2) set up nordvpn mesh network
my laptop is: b65535-andes.nord
my windows is: b65535-olympic.nord

3) samba between windows and linux
4) go through all my router setting and make sure I understand them, learning adventure
5) research nfc to read my sugar numbers on my pc
6) write a detective type book?
